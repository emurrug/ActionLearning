I was slightly confused about the down time after each ~5 min video played before the screen changed as I was not sure if I was supposed to replay the video 3 times or if the screen would change on its own. Additionally, I am a slow turner so I may have missed the move that came after the full body move",I tried to perform the tasks that were displayed on the screen to see what move I believed would come next. I did not do this for the part asking if a particular sequence appeared in the video however.,"I thought they were clear

I think people who had some kind of practice protocol where they did the movements along with the video will remember more.","Nothing was very hard to understand, just... the video was very long and boring when you're watching it and not doing anything else along with it",It was really hard to stay focused but I just tried to mentally name every action the man in the video did,They're clear

Also, it could be helpful to instruct participants to complete the study in a quiet space, alone, and/or with no distractions.

- I would put on the first instructional page that the videos of movements won't be recorded - I think that would make people more likely to take the study. Also, on that first page, I would say that they need to have a clear space around their computer for doing standing movements
- I would put everything about dance training, outdoor activities, and sports on one page so that people can see all the options, particularly if you have write-in options
- When watching the 5 min videos, I'd put the instructions for what people should do while watching at the top of that page (e.g. stand still / sit) to remind them
- When watching the short clips (3 movement sequences), the time available to watch them frequently eclipsed before the videos were done loading, and the video played. I would cue the timer to start only once the ""play"" button was clicked, and the video terminated, especially given that people may have a range of internet available
- It might be good to specify if you want people to be standing or seated while answering your questions - a banner across the top would work there as well",Linking them together using real world scenarios or stories,"These were clear, but again, I think it would help to have a written reminder (or picture) of the tasks at the top while people watched the movies"

Probably movement production has a more bimodal distribution of how sure people are in their answers (either very sure or not sure at all) than in comprehension, but not sure about that one. Felt like that anyway.","The patterns felt too sparse (or else i'm really bad at picking some of them up), so watching the videos felt a little confusing some times.","Predictive coding, basically.","Yes, but I never got the direction of the little spin right. I also feared all the time that I was going to miss the next movement in the screen. Might be a good idea to switch for something you can do while looking at the screen."
