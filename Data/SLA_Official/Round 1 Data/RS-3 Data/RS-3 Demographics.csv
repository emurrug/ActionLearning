Perhaps this study relates to mirror neurons and their activity. ","That replicating the movements could lead to more accurate memory recall. ","The expectation to keep our legs and arms moving at a steady pace while we mirrored the actions in the video; should we have been moving while performing the actions or simply during the pauses in between? ","I tried to use associations of arm and leg movements I'd often seen performed in succession. ","These images were a bit confusing on their own but helpful when coupled with explanatory text. "
