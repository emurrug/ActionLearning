","Based off my experience with the study (I did not answer any of the questions correctly and was not confident in my answers), I would guess the results would show that many people have trouble remembering patterns in movement. But maybe their memory is not always completely off- maybe a lot of people get the correct movement but on the wrong side, or the right side but the wrong movement.  ","I watched the 3rd of the videos while standing, as I did with the 2nd video- I forget if there were instructions to just stand still for the 3rd video but I remember being confused, as if the 2nd video was accidentally replaying. Maybe instructions to keep standing for the 3rd video would help? Also, for the extracurricular activity section instructions, I believe the third column was labelled ""second.""  ","I tried not to think too hard about the movement that comes next because, to be honest, I didn't catch hold of any patterns while watching, even though I tried at times.
