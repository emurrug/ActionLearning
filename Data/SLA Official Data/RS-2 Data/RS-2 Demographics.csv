Maybe it was also about how standing up or sitting down affects memory, or about how well people can mirror movements. ","Based off my experience with the study (I did not answer any of the questions correctly and was not confident in my answers), I would guess the results would show that many people have trouble remembering patterns in movement. But maybe their memory is not always completely off- maybe a lot of people get the correct movement but on the wrong side, or the right side but the wrong movement.  ","I watched the 3rd of the videos while standing, as I did with the 2nd video- I forget if there were instructions to just stand still for the 3rd video but I remember being confused, as if the 2nd video was accidentally replaying. Maybe instructions to keep standing for the 3rd video would help? Also, for the extracurricular activity section instructions, I believe the third column was labelled ""second.""  ","I tried not to think too hard about the movement that comes next because, to be honest, I didn't catch hold of any patterns while watching, even though I tried at times. I thought that thinking/concentrating hard would just make me indecisive, so when it came time to make my movement, I just tried to let it come naturally and subconsciously to me. ","I thought they were clear. I interpreted them as: move the opposite side as the person on screen, and stand instead of sitting. "
