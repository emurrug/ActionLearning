## Repsitory Directory

### Key
* *SLA Study Survey Format* — a document version of the study, with all the question and video names woven in.
* *SLA Study Key Code* — a key code for the video and question names that appear in the survey and the excel files.

### Data
* *Pilot Data All* — data from recall and recognition tasks.
* *Pilot Demographics & Feedback All* — combined sheet with demographic data and feedback/debrief question responses.
* *Pilot Experience Survey Overview* — short sheet displaying which dance forms, martial arts, outdoor activities, and sports participants have formal training in.
* *Pilot Experience Survey Dance/Martial Arts/Outdoor/Sports* — nitty gritty details on 1) how long they’ve been training, 2) how recent that training was, and 3) 
self-scored expertise level in the skill. The 1, 2, and 3 above correspond to how Qualtrics translated these three columns, as they appeared in the survey, to excel sheet columns.

### R Scripts
* *statistical_action_learning_script* - the OG R script that has (maybe too many) notes meant to get users started with R and stats for the first time
* *[TBD]* - the script with the study-specific variables plugged in
