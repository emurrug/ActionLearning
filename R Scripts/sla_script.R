# MC: I'm creating this as a slightly more abbreviated file than statistical_action_learning_script.R.
# I hope to consolidate the most relevant code here, and will probably be doing cleaning and editing
# in this file from now on. (4 March 2021)

### GETTING STARTED ###
library(readr)   #reading CSV's
library(kableExtra)   #formatting table
library(pastecs) #describes data
library(dplyr)   #manipulating data to view it
library(ggplot2) #visualizing data with graphs (we don't talk about the first "ggplot")
library(emmeans) #post hoc analyses (contrasts!)
library(magrittr) #not sure if I need this one?
